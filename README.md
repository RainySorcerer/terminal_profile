## Steps to Run the Script

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the script's repository to your system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RainySorcerer/terminal_profile.git
cd terminal_profile
```

### 2. Download and Run the Script Directly (Optional)
If you prefer, you can download the script using `wget` and run it directly:
```bash
wget -O terminal.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainySorcerer/terminal_profile/main/terminal.sh
chmod +x terminal.sh
./terminal.sh
```

### 3. Run the Script
After cloning or downloading, execute the script:
```bash
./terminal.sh
```

### 4. Follow the Prompts
The script will:

- Install all required tools and themes.
- Log you out after completion.

Once the script finishes, log back into your session.

## What Happens After the Script Runs?
1. **Fish Shell:** Youâ€™ll be greeted by Fish Shell as your default terminal shell.
2. **Oh My Posh:** A beautiful prompt theme will be applied using Oh My Posh.
3. **Nerd Fonts:** The terminal will use Fira Code Nerd Font Retina for better visuals.
4. **Theme Applied:** Your terminal will have the Everforest Dark Hard color scheme as the default.

---

## Notes:
- If GNOME Terminal doesnâ€™t immediately use Fish Shell as the default shell, logout and login again.
- The script handles logging out automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **"Unsupported or unknown distribution" error:**
  Ensure your system is based on Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch.

- **Permissions issues:**
  Ensure the script has executable permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x terminal.sh
  ```

- **Fish not loading by default:**
  Ensure you log out and log back in after the script runs.
